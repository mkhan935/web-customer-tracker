# web-customer-tracker
A basic spring mvc/hibernate project, side project for my own interests and practice

I wanted to review the basics of Spring MVC and Hibernate, what better way then to make CRUD MVC application!

My application is just a basic customer tracker of sorts, a admin(me) can add his/her customers to the list, customers have first name, 
last name, and email. There is also a link to either update the customer or delete the customer. 

I just did this to go over spring's mvc configurations and how a spring application was done before spring boot. I linked this application 
to a MYSQL database and used the Hibernate framework to make my life easy, Hibernate allows me to query the databse for my mapped objects much 
easier then a normal standard jdbc connection, not to mention i wont have to keep repeating the jdbc code. 

If anyone out there is actually viewing this, I hope you try to make a similar application as well, it teaches you the 
basics of enterprise development in Java and gives a deeper meaning when we use Spring Boot.

Functionality (so far) - 

Home Page - A List of all current Customers, add button to lead to form page to add new customer
